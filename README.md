# SmartLensApp

System Technologies:-

This web application was made on the MERN stack with jsx and 
bootstrab on the frontend and express and Node at the backend.
The DB is created on the MongoDB Atlas cloud. Where all the 
models have been stored. The backend and frontend are connected
with Axios. 

The application is already deployed on Heroku on the following URL:-
"https://smartlensapplication.herokuapp.com"

How to depploy:-
The code is available to be deployed over heroku for now. 
For deployment and integration the base URL for the Axios and file 
requests will need to be changed to the base URL of the heroku application
and then it can be directly deployed to heroku as an independent application. 

How to run on localhost:-
The repository contains code for both the server and the client as per the 
MVC model. The view is situated in the client. The controller and models are 
in the server.js directory. 

Run the following commands in the server.js directory:-
1. npm install
2. nodemon server

Once the server is connected to the DB:-
"[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server is running on port: 5000
MongoDB connection established successfully"

Run the following commands inside the client directory:-
1. npm install
2. npm start

Your default browser should open new tab with the running application.
